a. 3

The loop makes 'p' go to the last element. Then prints its data.

b. The head changes each time at the loop and breaks the connection of the list by removing the
first element each time. Finally head is null and list is empty.

A helper object should be added (Node p):

int s = 0;
Node p = head;
while (p != null) 
{
	s += head.data;
	p = p.next;
}
System.out.println(s);
