Algorithm 1: 
- best case - first element: O(1)
- worst case - go through all the elements: O(n)

Algorithm 2:
- best case - the last element: O(1)
- worst case - go through all the elements: O(n)

Algorithm 3:
- best case - the middle element: O(1)
- worst case - separate on two parts as much times as it could be done for n: O(log2(n)
