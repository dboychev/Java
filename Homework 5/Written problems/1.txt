- a reference to the head
- n nodes
- a reference to the tail

- Worst case runtime complexity for adding: we have a reference to the last node, so we can just 
add another one after it. O(1)

- Worst case runtime complexity for removing: we have a reference to the last node, but not to
the one before it. So when we remove the last one, the one before it should become the last one
and we can only get to him by starting from the top. O(n)
